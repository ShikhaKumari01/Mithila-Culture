   <p><b>Mithila,</b> also known as <em>Videh</em> has its boundary defined in Brihat Vishnu Puran (5th century A.D.) as : Gandaki in West, Kaushiki in East, Himalayas in North and Ganges in South. Since this region is interspersed with fifteen rivers, hence it is also known as Tirbhukti i.e., the land on the bank of rivers.In India, that region consists of Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, East Champaran, Khagaria, Madhepura, Madhubani, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Saharsa, Samastipur, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Supaul, Vaishali and West Champaran.  The people residing in this region are called Maithils and their language is <em>Maithili.</em> <br>According to Sir John Abraham Grierson (1881-82) : <b>"It is a country with its own tradition, its own poets and its own pride in everything belonging to itself."</b> <br>The region’s name evolved from Mythical King ‘Miti’ which means “Soil”. It is said that the capital of ancient Mithila Janpad was Janakpur in the Dhanusa district of Nepal.

    Mithila region is specifically mentioned in Ramayana, as it is known as the birth place of Sita ( The wife of Lord Rama). 
    
    This Mithila is more renowned for being the birth place of Goddess Sita. Because of the introduction of Goddess Sita in Mithila, consistently Janaki Navami is praised in Nepal. 
    
    The name Mithila is normally used to refer to the Videha Kingdom, just as to the advanced domains that fall inside the antiquated limits of Videha. In the eighteenth century, when Mithila was as yet managed to some degree by the Raj Darbhanga, the British Raj added the area without remembering it as an august state.</p>

Since there is no course wise meal practice therefore there is no well defined Gastronomique practice too, and hence people give equal importance to all kinds of preparations and take pleasure in enjoying each and every delicacy to the fullest. 
Maithils always give immense priority to milk products in their food which could perfectly be measured with this old saying “ Aadi Ghee aur Ant Dahi, oyi Bhojan k Bhojan kahi” ( A meal is the Meal that starts with Ghee and ends with Yogurt).
